# UW-AMATH-581: Scientific Computing
## Course Purpose:
Survey of practical numerical solution techniques for ordinary and partial differential systems. Emphasis will be on the implementation of numerical schemes to practical problems of engineering and physical sciences. Methods for partial differential equations will include finite differences, finite elements, and spectral techniques.


## Course Scope:
1. Solution Methods for Differential Equations:
    * Initial value problems
    * Euler method, 2nd- and 4th-order Runge-Kutta, Adams-Bashford
    * Stability
    * Boundary values problems: shooting/collocation/relaxation
 
2. Finite Difference Schemes for Partial Differential Equations: 
    * Collocation
    * Stability and CFL conditions
    * Time and space stepping routines
    * Tri-diagonal matrix operations
 
3. Spectral Methods for Partial Differential Equations:
    * The Fast-Fourier transform (FFT)
    * Chebychev transforms
    * ~~Time and space stepping routines~~
    * ~~Numerical filtering algorithms~~
 
4. Brief intro in Finite Element Methods


## Homework assignments:

## Final Project:
    * Solve the Bose-Einstein Condensation problem (Gross-Pitaevskii equations) in 3D and write a report on your
    investigation and the numerical approach. Include your best visualization of the 3D solutions.
    * For Graduate Students: Suggest and thoroughly discuss other 3D problems that could be solved using a similar
    numerical approach (i.e. include pseudo code) and visualization methods.
