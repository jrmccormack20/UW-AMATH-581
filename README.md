# UW-AMATH-581: Scientific Computing
## Course Purpose:
Survey of practical numerical solution techniques for ordinary and partial differential systems. Emphasis will be on the implementation of numerical schemes to practical problems of engineering and physical sciences. Methods for partial differential equations will include finite differences, finite elements, and spectral techniques.


## Course Scope:
1. Solution Methods for Differential Equations:
    * Initial value problems
    * Euler method, 2nd- and 4th-order Runge-Kutta, Adams-Bashford
    * Stability
    * Boundary value problems: shooting and direct methods
 
2. Finite Difference Method for Partial Differential Equations: 
    * Finite Difference Discretization
    * Stability and CFL conditions
    * Time and Space Stepping routines
 
3. Spectral Methods for Partial Differential Equations:
    * The Fast-Fourier transform (FFT)
    * Chebychev (and other) transform
    * Time and Space Stepping routines
    * ~~Numerical filtering algorithms~~
 
4. Brief intro in Finite Element Methods


## Homework assignments:

1. Solving 1st and 2nd order ODEs
2. Solving BVPs with shooting and direct methods
3. Setup Laplacian and 1st Partial Derivative Matrices
4. Solve PDE with Finite Difference and Semi-Spectral methods
5. Solve PDE with FFT and CHebychev Spectral methods

## Final Project:
    * Solve the Bose-Einstein Condensation problem (Gross-Pitaevskii equations) in 3D and write a report on your
    investigation and the numerical approach. Include your best visualization of the 3D solutions.
    * For Graduate Students: Suggest and thoroughly discuss other 3D problems that could be solved using a similar
    numerical approach (i.e. include pseudo code) and visualization methods.
